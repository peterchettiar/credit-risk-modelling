# credit-risk-modelling
_Objective_: To build an ML classification model using a credit risk dataset from Kaggle. Outcome is to predict the 'loan status' type from a given set of inputs. There are a few types of loan statuses, hence a multi-class algorithm needs to be used to predict which class the target variable belongs to.

> Quick note: The [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranadeep/credit-risk-dataset/data) dataset is larger than the size limit prescribed by Github and hence unable to upload. But feel free to download it directly by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranadeep/credit-risk-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=3).

# Introduction

I guess a great place to start would be the technical architecture of the project. The flow of the project is as follows:
